# Hi, I'm Jakub

## My approach to software development
I create free and open source software. I try my best to keep it simple, minimal and lightweight.
My favorite languages for developing all kinds of software are C and C++.

## How I do my coding
I currently find myself using Arch GNU/Linux as my daily driver. My code editor of choice is Vim.
