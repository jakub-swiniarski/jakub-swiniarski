# Hi, I'm Jakub

## My approach to software development
I create free and open source software. I try my best to keep it simple, minimal and lightweight. <br/>
My favorite languages for developing all kinds of software are C and C++.

## How I do my coding
Arch GNU/Linux is my daily driver operating system. I use [my custom fork of dwm](https://github.com/jakub-swiniarski/dwm) as my window manager. My code editor of choice is Vim. You can find my Vim config [here](https://github.com/jakub-swiniarski/vim-config).

> "An idiot admires complexity, a genius admires simplicity." <br/>
> — Terry A. Davis
